# Aube 

This is a toy version of the audiobook landscape I imagine for complex/harder books and academics/lecture.

- [x] UI/UX for the demo.
- [ ] Audio Integration and controls for the toy chapter.
- [ ] Audio control on voice detection (browser based execution preffered)
- [ ] Detection of voice stops the chapter read so that it could listen and process your question.
- [ ] Take in that request and generate an answer quick. Result it in side tab with time-stamp.
- [ ] Figure out readout of it (browser based or edge computation).
- [ ] MVP done.
- [ ] Harder Complex Vernacular to links (with tab view / serve images and easy explaination and links).
