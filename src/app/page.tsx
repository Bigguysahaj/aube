            To my mind it is worth while to relate not only the serious acts of
            great and good men but also what they do in their lighter moods. I
            should like to narrate an experience of mine that gives me this
            conviction. [2] It was on the occasion of the horse-races at the
            greater Panathenaic games; Callias, Hipponicus' son, was enamoured,
            as it happened, of the boy Autolycus, and in honour of his victory
            in the pancratium1 had brought him to see the spectacle. When the
            racing was over, Callias proceeded on his way to his house in the
            Peiraeus with Autolycus and the boy's father; Niceratus also was in
            his company. [3] But on catching sight of a group comprising
            Socrates, Critobulus, Hermogenes, Antisthenes, and Charmides,
            Callias bade one of his servants escort Autolycus and the others,
            and himself going over to Socrates and his companions, said, [4]
            “This is an opportune meeting, for I am about to give a dinner in
            honour of Autolycus and his father; and I think that my
            entertainment would present a great deal more brilliance if my
            dining-room were graced with the presence of men like you, whose
            hearts have undergone philosophy's purification, than it would with
            generals and cavalry commanders and office-seekers.” [5] “You are
            always quizzing us,” replied Socrates; “for you have yourself paid a
            good deal of money for wisdom to Protagoras, Gorgias, Prodicus, and
            many others, while you see that we are what you might call amateurs
            in philosophy; and so you feel supercilious toward us.” [6] “Yes,”
            said Callias, “so far, I admit, I have been keeping you ignorant of
            my ability at profound and lengthy discourse; but now, if you will
            favour me with your company, I will prove to you that I am a person
            of some consequence.” [7] Now at first Socrates and his companions
            thanked him for the invitation, as might be expected, but would not
            promise to attend the banquet; when it became clear, however, that
            he was taking their refusal very much to heart, they went with him.
            And so his guests arrived, some having first taken their exercise
            and their rub-down, others with the addition of a bath. [8]
            Autolycus took a seat by his father's side; the others, of course,
            reclined.2 A person who took note of the course of events would have
            come at once to the conclusion that beauty is in its essence
            something regal, especially when, as in the present case of
            Autolycus, its possessor joins with it modesty and sobriety. [9] For
            in the first place, just as the sudden glow of a light at night
            draws all eyes to itself, so now the beauty of Autolycus compelled
            every one to look at him. And again, there was not one of the
            onlookers who did not feel his soul strangely stirred by the boy;
            some of them grew quieter than before, others even assumed some kind
            of a pose. [10] Now it is true that all who are under the influence
            of any of the gods seem well worth gazing at; but whereas those who
            are possessed of the other gods have a tendency to be sterner of
            countenance, more terrifying of voice, and more vehement, those who
            are inspired by chaste Love have a more tender look, subdue their
            voices to more gentle tones, and assume a supremely noble bearing.
            Such was the demeanour of Callias at this time under the influence
            of Love; and therefore he was an object well worth the gaze of those
            initiated into the worship of this god. [11] The company, then, were
            feasting in silence, as though some one in authority had commanded
            them to do so, when Philip the buffoon knocked at the door and told
            the porter to announce who he was and that he desired to be
            admitted; he added that with regard to food he had come all
            prepared, in all varieties—to dine on some other person's,—and that
            his servant was in great distress with the load he carried
            of—nothing, and with having an empty stomach. Hearing this, Callias
            said, [12] “Well, gentlemen, we cannot decently begrudge him at the
            least the shelter of our roof; so let him come in.” With the words
            he cast a glance at Autolycus, obviously trying to make out what he
            had thought of the pleasantry. [13] But Philip, standing at the
            threshold of the men's hall where the banquet was served, announced:
            “You all know that I am a jester; and so I have come here with a
            will, thinking it more of a joke to come to your dinner uninvited
            than to come by invitation.” “Well, then,” said Callias, “take a
            place; for the guests, though well fed, as you observe, on
            seriousness, are perhaps rather ill supplied with laughter.” [14] No
            sooner were they engaged in their dinner than Philip attempted a
            witticism, with a view to rendering the service that secured him all
            his dinner engagements; but on finding that he did not excite any
            laughter, he showed himself, for the time, considerably vexed. A
            little later, however, he must try another jest; but when they would
            not laugh at him this time either, he stopped while the dinner was
            in full swing, covered his head with his cloak, and lay down on his
            couch. [15] “What does this mean, Philip?” Callias inquired. “Are
            you seized with a pain?” Philip replied with a groan, “Yes, Callias,
            by Heaven, with a severe one; for since laughter has perished from
            the world, my business is ruined. For in times past, the reason why
            I got invitations to dinner was that I might stir up laughter among
            the guests and make them merry; but now, what will induce any one to
            invite me? For I could no more turn serious than I could become
            immortal; and certainly no one will invite me in the hope of a
            return invitation, as every one knows that there is not a vestige of
            tradition of bringing dinner into my house.” As he said this, he
            wiped his nose, and to judge by the sound, he was evidently weeping.
            [16] All tried to comfort him with the promise that they would laugh
            next time, and urged him to eat; and Critobulus actually burst out
            into a guffaw at his lugubrious moaning. The moment Philip heard the
            laughter he uncovered his head, and exhorting his spirit to be of
            good courage, in view of approaching engagements,3 he fell to eating
            again.
